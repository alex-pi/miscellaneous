As a result of human activities, however, these gases are entering the atmosphere more quickly than they are being removed, and thus their concentrations are increasing.",

Almost all of this increase is due to human activities",

Because sea ice is light-colored, it reflects more sunlight (solar energy) back to space than liquid water, thereby playing an important role in maintaining the Earth’s energy balance and helping to keep polar regions cool. As the amount of sea ice decreases, the Arctic region’s cooling effect is reduced, and this may initiate a “feedback loop” whereby ocean warming caused by more absorption of solar energy leads to an even greater loss of sea ice and further warming.",

Because snow is white, it absorbs only a small portion of the sunlight that hits it (10 to 20 percent in the case of fresh snow), and it reflects the rest back to space. More snow means more energy reflects back to space, resulting in cooling, while less snow cover means more energy is absorbed at the Earth’s surface, resulting in warming.",

Warming temperatures associated with climate change are projected to increase the range of suitable tick habitat and are therefore one of multiple factors driving the observed spread of Lyme disease.
